# Getting Started with and using data in Meteor, React and FlowRouter

This is the sample app for two blog posts, "[Getting Started with Meteor 1.3, React 15, and FlowRouter](http://coderchronicles.org/2016/04/08/getting-started-with-meteor-1-3-react-and-flowrouter/)" and "[Using Data in Meteor with React and FlowRouter](http://coderchronicles.org/2016/04/15/using-data-in-meteor-with-react-and-flowrouter/)."

If you're new to Meteor (or to Meteor 1.3) and want to use it with React and FlowRouter, this is a great place to start.
